Last week at [.NET Conf 2023][dotnet-conf] was the stable release of .NET 8, the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release of the .NET platform.

With the release of .NET 8.0.0 and the end of the preview releases, my past week can be summed up by the following image:

## Summary

That's a wrap for .NET 8 for 2023 - now it becomes just _"the current version"_ for background patching and security updates.

As well as replacing both .NET 6 and 7 as the latest and greatest release with its status of LTS, .NET 8 brought us tonnes of improvements;

- Improved performance;
- C# 12;
- Expanded native AoT support;
- Aspire;
- and much more!

We truly are spoiled by the .NET team as they continue to invest and iterate on making it a highly competitive and productive development platform.

See you in 2024 for the .NET 9 upgrade! ðŸ˜Ž
