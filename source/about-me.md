title: About Me
---

My name is Martin, and I'm a software developer and tester based in London.

I've been working in software development for over 8 years now since leaving the University of Birmingham in 2006 with a BSc in Physics and Astrophysics.  My experience is primarily in the Microsoft technology stack with C# .NET, working on WCF and ASP.NET-based technologies alongside Microsoft SQL Server.

Besides technology, I'm a big fan of the cinema and like watching new films of many genres.  I've been working on a self-imposed challenge of watching all of the films in the IMDb Top 250 for the last 6 years.  The list is always moving which makes it tricky, but one day I'll get there!
