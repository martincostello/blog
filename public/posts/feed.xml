&lt;p>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bunch of testing with the &lt;a href="https://blog.martincostello.com/whats-new-for-openapi-with-dotnet-9/" title="What's New for OpenAPI with .NET 9">new OpenAPI support in .NET 9&lt;/a>.
As part of that testing, I wanted to take a look at how the performance of the new libraries compared to the existing
open source libraries for OpenAPI support in .NET, the most popular including &lt;a href="https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag" title="The NSwag repository on GitHub">NSwag&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" title="The Swashbuckle.AspNetCore repository on GitHub">Swashbuckle.AspNetCore&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's New for OpenAPI with .NET 9</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/whats-new-for-openapi-with-.net-9/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/whats-new-for-openapi-with-.net-9/</guid><description>&lt;img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="https://cdn.martincostello.com/blog_openapi.png" alt="The OpenAPI logo" title="The OpenAPI logo" height="272px" width="899px">
&lt;p>Developers in the .NET ecosystem have been writing APIs with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core for years, and
&lt;a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/" title="What Is OpenAPI?">OpenAPI&lt;/a> has been a popular choice for documenting those APIs.
OpenAPI at its core is a machine-readable document that describes the endpoints available in an API.
It contains information not only about parameters, requests and responses, but also additional metadata
such as descriptions of properties, security-related metadata, and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Look ma, no Dockerfile! üö´üêã - Publishing containers with the .NET SDK üì¶</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/look-ma-no-dockerfile-publishing-containers-with-the-.net-sdk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/look-ma-no-dockerfile-publishing-containers-with-the-.net-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="https://cdn.martincostello.com/blog_dotnet-containers.jpg" alt="A container ship being loaded with the .NET logo on the stern" title="A container ship being loaded with the .NET logo on the stern" height="384px" width="757px">

instead I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just catch-up with myself and summarise everything in this one blog post instead!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 4 - Preview 6</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-4-preview-6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-4-preview-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following on from &lt;a href="https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-3-previews-1-to-5" title="Previews 1-5">part 3&lt;/a> of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing

that you start off by testing the preview releases. Testing the preview releases is a great
way to get a head start on the upgrade process and to identify any issues sooner rather than
later, but it does require an investment of your time from preview to preview each month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to test new functionality, you still need to download the new .NET SDK,
update all the .NET SDK and NuGet package versions in your projects, and then test that everything
still works (that&amp;rsquo;s already automated at least, right?). This can be a time-consuming process over
the course of a new .NET release, and it starts to become harder to scale if you want to test lots
of different codebases with the latest preview of the next .NET release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 1 - Why Upgrade?</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-1-why-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-1-why-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, another new major version of .NET is coming - .NET &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong>, to be specific.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a .NET/C# developer, it&amp;rsquo;s quite likely (I hope!) that you write and run a lot of unit and integration tests for the applications you work on as part of your day-to-day job.

&lt;p>I find it so much more pleasurable to code against compared to &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; ASP.NET.

&lt;p>Testing HTTP dependencies in modern web applications is a common problem, but it‚Äôs also something that can
create difficulty for authoring reliable tests. Today, we‚Äôre open-sourcing a library to help reduce the friction
many developers have with this common requirement: JustEat.HttpClientInterception. You can find the repository in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/justeattakeaway/httpclient-interception">our GitHub organisation&lt;/a> and can find the package available to &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/JustEat.HttpClientInterception/">download at JustEat.HttpClientInterception on NuGet.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating to Amazon S3</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/migrating-to-amazon-s3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/migrating-to-amazon-s3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since I set up my blog in March 2014, it&amp;rsquo;s been running in IIS as part of an Azure App Service.

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back in June at &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/703/">WWDC&lt;/a>, Apple announced that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/">Apple Pay&lt;/a> was expanding its reach.
No longer just for apps and Wallet on TouchID compatible iOS devices and the Apple Watch, it would also
be coming to Safari in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in September 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just Eat was a launch partner when Apple Pay was released in the UK in our &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/just-eat-takeaway-food-delivery/id566347057">iOS app&lt;/a> in 2015.
We wanted to again be one of the first websites to support Apple Pay on the web by making it available within
&lt;a href="https://www.just-eat.co.uk/">just-eat.co.uk&lt;/a>. Our mission is to make food discovery exciting for everyone ‚Äì and supporting
Apple Pay for payment will make your experience even more dynamic and friction-free.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This Blog Is Now Open Source!</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/this-blog-is-now-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/this-blog-is-now-open-source/</guid><description>&lt;p>TL;DR - This blog is now hosted on &lt;a href="https://github.com/martincostello/blog">GitHub.com&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I set up this blog a while ago (March 2014 to be specific) and up until now it has been hosted in my Visual Studio Team Services (formerly Visual Studio Online, ne√© TFS Online) account, which effectively made this blog closed-source as VSTS is private.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there&amp;rsquo;s nothing sensitive in here anymore, and given that I &lt;a href="https://blog.martincostello.com/why-i-switched-from-wordpress-to-middleman/">wrote a whole blog post about porting to Middleman&lt;/a> I thought I&amp;rsquo;d push the whole repo (and its history) into the public eye to lay it bare for the world to see.

Initially I created a blog in &lt;a href="http://martincostello.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogspot&lt;/a> but I decided some time later that I&amp;rsquo;d rather host it myself with custom DNS, etc., mainly as a learning exercise. As I&amp;rsquo;m mostly a developer in the Microsoft stack, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d set it up in Windows Azure as an Azure Website (now a &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Azure Web App&amp;rdquo;) as that was something I knew of and knew a little about. A few clicks through a wizard later and I had a WordPress blog running in Azure, backed by a MySQL database.

&lt;p>So recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work ensuring some websites I work on are secure. This has been from a mix of hands-on testing of them myself, dealing with feedback from dedicated security testers testing the applications, and this week attending an &amp;ldquo;ASP.NET Secure Coding&amp;rdquo; training course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From my own testing I found the odd thing here and there during development based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve read in the past is best-practice. These were exclusively application/coding changes. Fixing these was a mix of &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah&amp;rdquo; realisations or a quick Google leading to MSDN or Stack Overflow, leading to some simple one-line changes here and there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
