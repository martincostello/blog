OpenAPI at its core is a machine-readable document that describes the endpoints available in an API.
It contains information not only about parameters, requests and responses, but also additional metadata
such as descriptions of properties, security-related metadata, and more.</p></p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><h2><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/look-ma-no-dockerfile-publishing-containers-with-the-.net-sdk/>Look ma, no Dockerfile! üö´üêã - Publishing containers with the .NET SDK üì¶</a></h2><p>2 May 2024 - <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src=https://cdn.martincostello.com/blog_dotnet-containers.jpg alt="A container ship being loaded with the .NET logo on the stern" title="A container ship being loaded with the .NET logo on the stern" height=384px width=757px><p>Containers have been a thing in the software ecosystem for a few years now, with lots of associated technologies and

that you start off by testing the preview releases. Testing the preview releases is a great
way to get a head start on the upgrade process and to identify any issues sooner rather than
later, but it does require an investment of your time from preview to preview each month.</p><p>Even if you don&rsquo;t want to test new functionality, you still need to download the new .NET SDK,
update all the .NET SDK and NuGet package versions in your projects, and then test that everything
still works (that&rsquo;s already automated at least, right?). This can be a time-consuming process over
the course of a new .NET release, and it starts to become harder to scale if you want to test lots
of different codebases with the latest preview of the next .NET release.</p></p></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><h2><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-1-why-upgrade/>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 1 - Why Upgrade?</a></h2><p>10 July 2023 -<p>Another year, another new major version of .NET is coming - .NET <strong>8</strong>, to be specific.</p><p>I write that like it&rsquo;s brand new information - it&rsquo;s been coming for a while, what with
