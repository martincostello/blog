<span class="fa-brands fa-bluesky" aria-hidden=true></span></a></div></div></p><p>This post is a bumper edition, covering three different releases:</p><ul><li><a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-preview-7/ title="Announcing .NET 8 Preview 7">Preview 7</a></li><li><a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-rc1/ title="Announcing .NET 8 RC1">Release Candidate 1</a></li><li><a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-rc2/ title="Announcing .NET 8 RC2">Release Candidate 2</a></li></ul><p>I had intended to continue the post-per-preview series originally, but time got away from me
with preview 7, plus there wasn&rsquo;t much to say about it, and then I went on holiday for two weeks
just as release candidate 1 landed. Given release candidate 2 was released just a few days ago,
instead I figured I&rsquo;d just catch-up with myself and summarise everything in this one blog post instead!</p><p>Release Candidate 2 is also the last planned release before the final release of .NET 8 in November
to coincide with <a href=https://www.dotnetconf.net/ title=".NET Conf 2023">.NET Conf 2023</a>, so this is going to be the penultimate post in this series.</p><p>READMORE</p><h2 id=preview-7>Preview 7</h2><p>From upgrading the various projects I&rsquo;ve been testing with .NET 8, there were no new issues
to report with preview 7 in August. There were, however, a few changes that I needed to make
with the introduction of a number of new warnings from analyzers added to the .NET SDK and some
of the new libraries.</p><h3 id=more-ca1849-warnings>More CA1849 Warnings</h3><p>A number of improvements were made to the <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1849>CA1849 analyzer</a> which resulted in a number
of new warnings being identified in code where synchronous versions of APIs were still being used
despite asynchronous versions now being being available.</p><p>The main one flushed out in this preview for the code I&rsquo;ve been testing was this:</p><pre class="highlight plaintext">
<code>using var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(Context.RequestAborted);
using var document = JsonDocument.Parse(stream);</code>
</pre><p>In these cases, the fix is trivial:</p><pre class="highlight plaintext">
<code>using var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(Context.RequestAborted);
using var document = await JsonDocument.ParseAsync(stream);</code>
</pre><h3 id=faketimeprovider-experimental-warnings>FakeTimeProvider Experimental Warnings</h3><p>Usage of the new <code>FakeTimeProvider</code> class started to emit a <code>EXTEXP0004</code> warning which needed to
be suppressed. These warnings were removed for RC2 by <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/4455 title="Remove experimental attributes following API reviews">dotnet/extensions#4455</a>
after the new libraries being formally API reviewed, but these just seemed to add noise for people
so I&rsquo;m not sure why they were needed in the first place if the intention was to ship the APIs as
stable for .NET 8 itself.</p><p>Typically things like <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/preview-features/preview-features.md title="Preview Features"><code>[RequiresPreviewFeatures(...)]</code></a> are used in
the core libraries for such warnings, and then only when a non-stable API is intended to be shipped
in a stable release, such as with the <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/ title="Preview Features in .NET 6 – Generic Math">Generic Math APIs in .NET 6</a>.</p><p>If this pattern were replicated for all new APIs added in new .NET releases before they reach release
candidate it would create <em>a lot</em> of noise for early adopters in my opinion. I hope such warning
patterns don&rsquo;t become commonplace across .NET in the future. 😄</p><h3 id=compositeformat>CompositeFormat</h3><p>As part of the performance improvements in .NET 8, a new type, <code>CompositeFormat</code>, has been added
to move the logic for formatting strings with composite formatting out of <code>string.Format()</code> every
time it is used for a specific usage to instead be amortised across all usages with one upfront cost
of parsing it. More information about this can be found in <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#numbers#string-formatting>Stephen Toub&rsquo;s <strong>epic</strong> blog post</a>
about performance in .NET 8 (grab a coffee first ☕).</p><p>The TL;DR for this though is to identify any usages of <code>string.Format()</code> that can be improved this way,
so a new <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1863>CA1863</a> analyzer warning has been added to the .NET SDK.</p><p>An example of a Git diff to change some string formatting to use this new pattern is shown below.</p><pre class="highlight plaintext">
<code>using System;
using System.Globalization;
+ using System.Text;

public class Greeter
{
+   private static readonly CompositeFormat GreetingFormat = CompositeFormat.Parse("Hello {0}!");
    public void PrintName(string name)
    {
-       Console.WriteLine(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Hello {0}!", name));
+       Console.WriteLine(string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, GreetingFormat, name));
    }
}</code>
</pre><h2 id=release-candidate-1>Release Candidate 1</h2><p>Release candidate 1 was released in September, and it was also the first release of .NET 8 that has
a <em>Go-Live</em> license, meaning it is supported by Microsoft for use in production. Once I got back from
my holiday, I updated all of the production (and <em>&ldquo;production&rdquo;</em>) applications I&rsquo;m responsible for to run
on .NET 8 using RC1.</p><p>Everything worked as expected once deployed, but there were a number of build-time issues that needed resolving.</p><h3 id=configuration-binding-source-generator>Configuration Binding Source Generator</h3><p>There were a number of regressions in changes made to the <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-preview-6/#configuration-binding-source-generator-improvements title="Configuration binding source generator improvements">new Configuration Binding Source Generator</a>
which unfortunately meant that it would not produce code that would compile for a number of my ASP.NET Core applications.</p><p>This meant that I had to turn it off completely for RC1. The issues below were all fixed for RC2, so I was able to re-enable it then.</p><ul><li><em><a href=https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90851 title="Fix source-gen issue with a binding member access expression being on a separate line from the member expression">Fix source-gen issue with a binding member access expression being on a separate line from the member expression</a></em></li><li><em><a href=https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90987 title="Config generator doesn't match nullability semantics of built-in Bind">Config generator doesn&rsquo;t match nullability semantics of built-in Bind</a></em></li><li><em><a href=https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/91258 title="Config binding gen omits a needed comma in an emitted Configure overload replacement">Config binding gen omits a needed comma in an emitted Configure overload replacement</a></em></li></ul><h3 id=daily-build-testing>Daily Build Testing</h3><p>Following the testing with .NET 8 daily builds I did to check a fix for the new Request Delegate Generator
in preview 6, I looked into updating my <a href=https://github.com/martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk title="martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk in GitHub">update-dotnet-sdk</a> GitHub Action to support
updating repositories based on the output of the <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/installer title="dotnet/installer repository in GitHub">dotnet/installer</a> repository. With the
<a href=https://github.com/martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk/releases/tag/v2.3.0 title="martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk v2.3.0">v2.3.0</a> release of the action, that became supported. With that released I started
to set up parallel branches in some of my repositories to test the daily builds of .NET 8 where I felt they&rsquo;d
use a wide range of capabilities to give good test coverage.</p><p>I might write a more in-depth blog post about this at some point as I&rsquo;m planning on using this approach
again next year for .NET 9 starting around preview 1. It&rsquo;s found a number of bugs that got caught before
an official preview release was published, so I think it&rsquo;s been a valuable investment of time.</p><p>Such an issue was <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90386 title="ObjectDisposedException intermittently crashes test process from DefaultHttpClientFactory.ExpiryTimer_Tick">dotnet/runtime#9038</a>. This was an issue where changes to HttpClientFactory
caused a background task to throw an exception when it was disposed. This in turn caused the .NET test process to
&ldquo;crash&rdquo;, causing all of my CI builds to fail. I was glad this was caught before RC1 as it would have been a big
blocker for me personally, as it would have caused a lot of test failures in my repositories that use the HttpClientFactory
to stub out HTTP requests in the integration tests (<em><a href=https://tech.justeattakeaway.com/2017/10/02/reliably-testing-http-integrations-in-a-dotnet-application/ title="Reliably Testing HTTP Integrations in a .NET Application">Reliably Testing HTTP Integrations in a .NET Application</a></em>).</p><h3 id=portable-runtime-identifiers>Portable Runtime Identifiers</h3><p>In .NET 8 the Runtime Identifiers (RIDs) used by projects targeting .NET 8 have been changed to be shorter/simpler
and more portable (see <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/36527 title="[Breaking change]: Projects targeting .NET 8 and higher will by default use a smaller, portable RID graph">dotnet/docs#36527</a>).</p><p>This had the consequence that for applications being published as a self-contained deployment for their targeted
operating system and architecture, the RID being previously used would now generate a build error.</p><p>For example, instead of publishing for <code>win10-x64</code> the RID is now <code>win-x64</code>.</p><p>This was a simple enough change to make, but affected a fair number of my repositories adopting .NET 8 as a result.</p><h3 id=c-12-by-default>C# 12 by Default</h3><p>The RC1 release also changed the default language version for C# projects to be C# 12.</p><p>Previously you needed to explictly set the <code>LangVersion</code> MSBuild property to either <code>preview</code>
or <code>12</code>, but as-of RC1 the value of <code>latest</code> (which is what I use) was updated to point to C# 12.</p><p>This change in turn caused a number of new warnings to be emitted by the compiler to suggest that new code patterns
be used where beneficial. A major source of these warnings came from the new <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-12.0/collection-expressions title="Collection expressions">collection expressions</a>
language feature.</p><p>For example, instead of writing this: <code>List&lt;string> names = new() { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };</code></p><p>You can now write this: <code>List&lt;string> names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];</code></p><p>Much terser!</p><p>From using it in a few places as suggested, I think I quite like the syntax as it is similar to JavaScript/TypeScript
array usage, so it feels quite natural to use to me. It also has the benefit of being able to leverage some
<a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#collection-expressions title="Collection expressions">new compiler smarts</a> to help improve the performance and memory allocation of your applications.</p><p>There were however two cases where analysers didn&rsquo;t like particular code constructs for C# 12. These needed to be suppressed,
but hopefully they&rsquo;ll be resolved in future releases of the relevant projects:</p><ul><li><em><a href=https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/issues/3687 title="SA1010 false positive when list syntax is used in a field initializer">SA1010 false positive when list syntax is used in a field initializer</a></em></li><li><em><a href=https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2789 title="xUnit1026 false positive with C# 12 collection literals">xUnit1026 false positive with C# 12 collection literals</a></em></li></ul><h3 id=new-analyzers>New Analyzers</h3><p>There were also a few new analyzers added to the .NET SDK in RC1 that raised new warnings.</p><h4 id=ca1869>CA1869</h4><p>The new <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1869>CA1869</a> analyzer warns if you are repeatedly creating a new <code>JsonSerializerOptions</code> instance in your code.</p><p>Doing this can potentially be a huge <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/#collection-expressions#json title=JSON>pit of failure</a> in an application.</p><p>I made a mistake in a production application during the .NET 5 timeframe where a misconfiguration of the dependency injection
container for an application meant that a new instance of <code>JsonSerializerOptions</code> was being created for every HTTP request,
rather than just once at startup. In that instance the application in question was affected to the tune of a 200% increase in
response times for requests!</p><p>Spot where the code change got deployed&mldr; 🕵️</p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src=https://cdn.martincostello.com/blog_jsonserializeroptions-too-slow.png alt="A graph showing the performance impact of the bad change" title="A graph showing the performance impact of the bad change"><p>While in this case the analyzer may not have helped as it was an issue with the dependency injection configuration, it&rsquo;s good to
know that investment has been made to help avoid developers causing the same problem in different scenarios.</p><h4 id=netsdk1212>NETSDK1212</h4><p>The trim analyzer for AOT has been present in the .NET SDK for a while, but what I didn&rsquo;t realise is that it isn&rsquo;t supported for
use on projects that don&rsquo;t target at least .NET 6. A new analyzer warning, NETSDK1212, was added to warn about this. This is easy
to fix if you have a project doing multi-targeting (such as <a href=https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly title="App-vNext/Polly on GitHub">Polly</a>) by adding a condition to project files where the
analyzer is enabled, like so:</p><pre class="highlight plaintext">
<code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="$([MSBuild]::IsTargetFrameworkCompatible('$(TargetFramework)', 'net6.0'))"&gt;
  &lt;EnableAotAnalyzer&gt;true&lt;/EnableAotAnalyzer&gt;
  &lt;EnableSingleFileAnalyzer&gt;true&lt;/EnableSingleFileAnalyzer&gt;
  &lt;EnableTrimAnalyzer&gt;true/EnableTrimAnalyzer&gt;
  &lt;IsTrimmable&gt;true&lt;/IsTrimmable&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</code>
</pre><h2 id=release-candidate-2>Release Candidate 2</h2><p>Release candidate 2 was released in October just a few days ago, and it&rsquo;s been pretty uneventful (for me at least).</p><p>Other than <a href=https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93335 title="Configuration Binding source generator throws InvalidOperationException at runtime for type with custom [TypeConverter] use within a dictionary">one issue I ran into</a> when I re-enabled the Configuration Binding Source Generator for
one project now the other issues I mentioned above had been fixed, I didn&rsquo;t experience any friction with RC2 at all.</p><p>Within a few hours of RC2 being released, I had updated all of the repositories I&rsquo;m responsible for that were running
RC1 to use .NET 8 RC2 instead. 🚀😎</p><p>Using my <a href=https://github.com/martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk title="martincostello/update-dotnet-sdk in GitHub">GitHub Action</a>, in most cases I didn&rsquo;t even make the changes myself!</p><p>For example, <a href=https://github.com/martincostello/costellobot/pull/892 title="Update .NET SDK to 8.0.100-rc.2.23502.2">this pull request</a> was automatically created to update one of my apps
from RC1 to RC2, and the deployed application produced in that repository approved it and deployed it to production
within 75 minutes of RC2 being released with no manual intervention at all. Most of the delay was waiting for GitHub
Actions runners to be available due to the contention caused by trying to update all my repositories at the same time!</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>With those repositories updated, it&rsquo;s just a case of waiting for the final release of .NET 8 in November and then
merging all of the other updates to things like libraries I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the stable release to merge.</p><p>For example, <a href=https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/pull/1144>updating Polly to use the new <code>TimeProvider</code> API</a> and replace
<a href=https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/e68645da0eb2270d442c7c229c3c801c48b5f1fc/src/Polly.Core/ToBeRemoved/TimeProvider.cs title="TimeProvider.cs in Polly">the internal copy of the code</a> used for the v8.0.0 release.</p><p>.NET 8 is shaping up to be a great release that will <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-8/ title="Performance Improvements in .NET 8">make your applications faster than ever</a>
with minimal developer effort to upgrade and reap the benefits, even if you don&rsquo;t use any new capabilities.</p><p>In the next and final post in this series, we&rsquo;ll take a look at completing the upgrades to the stable .NET 8 release!</p><h2 id=upgrading-to-net-8-series-links>Upgrading to .NET 8 Series Links</h2><p>You can find links to the other posts in this series below.</p><ul><li><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-1-why-upgrade title="Why Upgrade?">Part 1 - Why Upgrade?</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-2-automation-is-our-friend title="Automation is our Friend">Part 2 - Automation is our Friend</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-3-previews-1-to-5 title="Previews 1-5">Part 3 - Previews 1-5</a></li><li><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-4-preview-6 title="Preview 6">Part 4 - Preview 6</a></li><li>Part 5 - Preview 7 and Release Candidates 1 and 2 (this post)</li><li><a href=https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-6-stable-release title="The Stable Release">Part 6 - The Stable Release</a></li></ul><hr><p><div class=row><div class=col-lg-6><a href="https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Upgrading+to+.NET+8%3A+Part+5+-+Preview+7+and+Release+Candidates+1+and+2+by+%40martincostello.com+-+https%3A%2F%2Fblog.martincostello.com%2Fupgrading-to-.net-8-part-5-preview-7-and-release-candidates-1-and-2%2F" target=_blank rel=noopener class="btn btn-info btn-sm" title="Share on Bluesky">Share on Bluesky
