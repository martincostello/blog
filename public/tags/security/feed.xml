&lt;p>So recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work ensuring some websites I work on are secure. This has been from a mix of hands-on testing of them myself, dealing with feedback from dedicated security testers testing the applications, and this week attending an &amp;ldquo;ASP.NET Secure Coding&amp;rdquo; training course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From my own testing I found the odd thing here and there during development based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve read in the past is best-practice. These were exclusively application/coding changes. Fixing these was a mix of &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah&amp;rdquo; realisations or a quick Google leading to MSDN or Stack Overflow, leading to some simple one-line changes here and there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
