Initially I created a blog in &lt;a href="http://martincostello.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogspot&lt;/a> but I decided some time later that I&amp;rsquo;d rather host it myself with custom DNS, etc., mainly as a learning exercise. As I&amp;rsquo;m mostly a developer in the Microsoft stack, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d set it up in Windows Azure as an Azure Website (now a &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Azure Web App&amp;rdquo;) as that was something I knew of and knew a little about. A few clicks through a wizard later and I had a WordPress blog running in Azure, backed by a MySQL database. Great - time to get blogging!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
