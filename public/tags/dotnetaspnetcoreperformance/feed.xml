&lt;p>Writing code that millions of people will use is something we do every day. Writing code that millions
of developers will use feels a little different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you ever wondered why Microsoft releases preview versions of their products before the final release?
Well, itâ€™s so real customers can help ensure their quality before they go live. In this post, weâ€™ll tell you
about an issue we found in testing the previews of ASP.NET Core and how we worked with Microsoft to fix it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.1 for Productivity and Performance Gains</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrade-to-asp.net-core-2.1-for-productivity-and-performance-gains/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrade-to-asp.net-core-2.1-for-productivity-and-performance-gains/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using .NET Core since it was released &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/06/27/announcing-net-core-1-0/" title="Announcing .NET Core 1.0">back in June 2016&lt;/a> as my development technology of choice for my personal projects, as well as helping introduce it as a mainstream technology choice at &lt;a href="https://www.just-eat.com/" title="Just Eat global website">Just Eat&lt;/a> (my employer at the time of writing).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it so much more pleasurable to code against compared to &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; ASP.NET. With features such as self-hosting, built-in dependency injection and a high level of testability, you can really focus on solving the domain problem at hand, rather than worrying too much over boilerplate and ceremony.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ASP.NET Core 2.1 â€“ Supercharging Our Applications ðŸš€</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/asp.net-core-2.1-supercharging-our-applications/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/asp.net-core-2.1-supercharging-our-applications/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-2-1-0-now-available/">ASP.NET Core 2.1&lt;/a> was released by Microsoft at the end of May, and last week we deployed
two consumer-facing applications upgraded to use ASP.NET Core 2.1 to production for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These applications have now been run in production for an entire weekend of peak traffic, and weâ€™ve seen
some great performance improvements â€“ in some cases &lt;strong>improving average response times by over 40%&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
