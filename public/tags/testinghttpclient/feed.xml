&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Testing HTTP dependencies in modern web applications is a common problem, but it’s also something that can
create difficulty for authoring reliable tests. Today, we’re open-sourcing a library to help reduce the friction
many developers have with this common requirement: JustEat.HttpClientInterception. You can find the repository in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/justeattakeaway/httpclient-interception">our GitHub organisation&lt;/a> and can find the package available to &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/JustEat.HttpClientInterception/">download at JustEat.HttpClientInterception on NuGet.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
