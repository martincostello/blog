&lt;p>With the release of .NET 8.0.0 and the end of the preview releases, my past week can be summed up by the following image:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-preview-7/" title="Announcing .NET 8 Preview 7">Preview 7&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-rc1/" title="Announcing .NET 8 RC1">Release Candidate 1&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-rc2/" title="Announcing .NET 8 RC2">Release Candidate 2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I had intended to continue the post-per-preview series originally, but time got away from me
with preview 7, plus there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to say about it, and then I went on holiday for two weeks
just as release candidate 1 landed. Given release candidate 2 was released just a few days ago,
instead I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just catch-up with myself and summarise everything in this one blog post instead!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 4 - Preview 6</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-4-preview-6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-4-preview-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following on from &lt;a href="https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-3-previews-1-to-5" title="Previews 1-5">part 3&lt;/a> of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing
to upgrade my projects to .NET 8 - this time to preview 6. In this post
I&amp;rsquo;ll cover more experiences with the new source generators with this
preview as well as a new feature of C# 12: &lt;em>primary constructors&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Preview 6 includes further changes to the &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-8-preview-3/#minimal-apis-and-native-aot" title="Minimal APIs and native AOT">Request Delegate Generator&lt;/a>&lt;/em>
since last month&amp;rsquo;s preview 5, so time to dive in again and see how things
are shaping up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 3 - Previews 1-5</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-3-previews-1-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-3-previews-1-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-dotnet-8-part-2-automation-is-our-friend" title="Automation is our Friend">previous post of this series&lt;/a> I described how with some
GitHub Actions workflows we can reduce the amount of manual work required
to test each preview of .NET 8 in our projects. With the infrastructure to
do that set up we can now dig into some highlights of the things we found
in our testing of .NET 8 itself in the preview releases available so far
this year!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to .NET 8: Part 1 - Why Upgrade?</title><link>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-1-why-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.martincostello.com/upgrading-to-.net-8-part-1-why-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, another new major version of .NET is coming - .NET &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong>, to be specific.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I write that like it&amp;rsquo;s brand new information - it&amp;rsquo;s been coming for a while, what with
&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-preview-1/" title="Announcing .NET 8 Preview 1">.NET 8 Preview 1 having being released in Feburary&lt;/a> - but it&amp;rsquo;s only
recently occured to me to write this blog post series (yes, a series, more on that later).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As annouced a few releases ago, a new major version of .NET is &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#cadence" title=".NET release cadence">released every November&lt;/a>.
These alternate between an odd-numbered Short Term Support (STS) release and an even-numbered
Long Term Support (LTS) release (&lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#release-types" title=".NET Release types">see here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
