&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Back in June at &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/703/">WWDC&lt;/a>, Apple announced that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/">Apple Pay&lt;/a> was expanding its reach.
No longer just for apps and Wallet on TouchID compatible iOS devices and the Apple Watch, it would also
be coming to Safari in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in September 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just Eat was a launch partner when Apple Pay was released in the UK in our &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/just-eat-takeaway-food-delivery/id566347057">iOS app&lt;/a> in 2015.
We wanted to again be one of the first websites to support Apple Pay on the web by making it available within
&lt;a href="https://www.just-eat.co.uk/">just-eat.co.uk&lt;/a>. Our mission is to make food discovery exciting for everyone â€“ and supporting
Apple Pay for payment will make your experience even more dynamic and friction-free.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
